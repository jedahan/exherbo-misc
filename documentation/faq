Frequently Asked Questions
==========================
  Remember, Exherbo is all about choice, so there are a ton of correct answers to many of these questions. This FAQ just aims to give the simplest of those possible answers.


Basics
------
*  Why use Exherbo?
    If you like to know exactly what is going on with your system, you might like Exherbo. If you like to try new alternatives while still having a stable day-to-day system, you might like Exherbo.

How do I...
-----------

*  **...add new repositories?**  
    If you want to add the x11 repository, /etc/paludis/repositories/x11.conf should look like the following:  
        ``location = ${ROOT}/var/db/paludis/repositories/x11  
          sync = git://git.exherbo.org/x11.git  
          format = exheres  
          names_cache = ${ROOT}/var/cache/paludis/names  
          write_cache = ${ROOT}/var/cache/paludis/metadata``  
    When syncing a repository for the first time, prepend x- since paludis doesn't know what the real name is yet  
        ``# paludis -s x-x11``
	
*  **...work with binary packages?**  
    You are going to have to delve a bit into the source code / comments, as this feature is not meant for end-users just yet. It does work though!

*  **...manage packages not in any repository?**  
    Use importare! If you have the source untarred in some directory, and you already did ./configure && make, try the following.  
        ``# importare --install --location ~/code/foo-v0.3.4/ category/foo 0.3.4``
    
*  **...start writing my own exheres?**  
    Exheres for smarties is the go-to-guide, but it may be overwhelming for people new to packaging in general.  For paludis to know everything it needs to correctly install a particular package, the bare minimum is the package name, version, build dependencies, run dependencies, and source location.


Package Masked Errors
---------------------    

*  **Masked by unavailable**  
    ``* All versions of '>=dev-perl/XML-Simple-2' are masked. Candidates are:    
        * dev-perl/XML-Simple-2.18:0::unavailable (in ::perl): Masked by unavailable (In a repository which is unavailable)``  
    See 'How do I add new repositories' above, and add the perl repository. Then run ``# paludis -s x-perl``
