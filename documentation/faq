Frequently Asked Questions
==========================
  Remember, Exherbo is all about choice, so there are a ton of correct answers to many of these questions. This FAQ just aims to give the simplest of those possible answers.

How do I...
-----------

*  **...view or add new repositories?**  
    Try using playman, a script for managing repositories that comes with paludis if you enable the ruby option.  
    ``# echo "sys-apps/paludis ruby" >> /etc/paludis/options.conf  
      # paludis -i paludis  
      # playman -h``  
	
*  **...work with binary packages?**  
    You are going to have to delve a bit into the source code / comments, as this feature is not meant for end-users just yet. It does work though!

*  **...manage packages not in any repository?**  
    Use importare! If you have the source untarred in some directory, and you already did ./configure && make, try the following.  
        ``# importare --install --location ~/code/foo-v0.3.4/ category/foo 0.3.4``
    
*  **...start writing my own exheres?**  
    Exheres for smarties is the go-to-guide, but it may be overwhelming for people new to packaging in general.  For paludis to know everything it needs to correctly install a particular package, the bare minimum is the package name, version, build dependencies, run dependencies, and source location.


Package Masked Errors
---------------------    

*  **Masked by unavailable**  
    ``* All versions of '>=dev-perl/XML-Simple-2' are masked. Candidates are:    
        * dev-perl/XML-Simple-2.18:0::unavailable (in ::perl): Masked by unavailable (In a repository which is unavailable)``  
    Try ``# playman -a perl && paludis -s x-perl``
