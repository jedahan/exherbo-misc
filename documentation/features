Philosophy
==========
    Exherbo aims to be a stable and flexible distribution for developers and tinkerers, people who need thier distribution to help them be productive while having fun.  Clear, up-front configuration and excellent support for decentralized development help realize this goal. Other features that Exherbo values include:


*  A small core development team
    A small team is one that can adapt quickly to changes and keep focus on the philosophy of Exherbo. The downside to this is that a team of ~20 cannot maintain 2000+ packages. Exherbo solves this issue by offering robust distributed repository management, opting for many small repositories that integrate seamlessly with everyday management.

*  Flexibility where it makes sense
    Paludis can work with both source-based and binary packages on equal terms, even if they are no defined exheres-based packages for them! Finally you can get the speed of a binary distribution with the control of a source-based one.

*  Tightly integrated bug-reporting
    With the unwritten repository, packages that haven't been made can be tracked by the distribution itself, speeding up workflow.

*  Simple, safe account management
    Safe and tracked account management, with users and groups managed by the system so you don't have to worry about them.

*  Alternatives
    If program Y does everything X does, but better, Exherbo can use Y instead of X without having to muck about with the exheres.
