  documentation/
         features: Just paraphrasing the 10 cool things about Exherbo FOSDEM talk. 
	           Mean to casually describe some of the benefits of exherbo without 
		   going into detail about how they work.
    install-guide: Should this be more / less verbose?
              faq: always looking for more questions
